The protein “small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N” is encoded by the SNRPN gene, which functions in pre-mRNA processing and may contribute to tissue-specific alternative splicing. 
This gene is located within the Prader-Willi Syndrome critical region on chromosome 15 and is imprinted and expressed from the paternal allele. 
Observing the gene, multiple translation initiation sites have been identified and an upstream protein coding region SNURF is discovered, but the function of the SNURF protein is unknown. 
The short uORF in front of the SNURF gene enhances the translation of SNRPN by allowing the ribosomal subunit to skip the SNURF gene and re-initiate translation at SNRPN. 

The research this semester aims to explore all other possible mammalian genes that contain the upstream protein coding region with a short uORF. 
Potentially, a small machine-learning program will be developed to classify whether input uORFs are potential protein-coding regions.
